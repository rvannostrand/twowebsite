weight: 1
---

This course focuses on teaching undergraduates the basics of international relations, covering a diverse array of topics including civil and interstate war, human rights, terrorism, international trade, monetary policy, and climate change. Students are asked to write two Op-Ed pieces where they evaluate the  policy response to a current event in international relations, and provide a set of solutions to address that problem. This assignment not only challenges students to be engaged with international issues, but to persuade an audience about the preferred policy response.
