Rachel Van Nostrand is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Arizona. Her research interests lie at the intersection of human rights, repression, post-conflict environments, and geographies of violence. Her dissertation focuses on the cross national study concentration camp systems. By creating a novel dataset of concentration camps from 1946-2018, she examines the strategic motivations underlying concentration camp use within states' repertoires of repression. In her free time, she enjoys practicing bass guitar, playing D&D, hiking, and rock climbing.
